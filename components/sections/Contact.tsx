/**
 * Contact (§6.1 item 10). A server component; the form is a client leaf.
 *
 * Mobile first (§4.7): the pitch stacks above the form, and `lg:` only adds
 * the two-column split. The mail address sits with the pitch because some
 * readers will never use the form — it comes from `lib/nav` so it cannot
 * drift from the copy in the footer.
 *
 * No accent in this section — the CTA band below it owns the page's one
 * accent element, and the form's own submit button already carries the
 * primary variant, which is the single glowing thing in this viewport.
 *
 * `heading` is the one thing that changes between the home page and
 * `/contact`: there it is the page's `h1`. Same section, same copy, so the
 * two can never say different things about the reply time.
