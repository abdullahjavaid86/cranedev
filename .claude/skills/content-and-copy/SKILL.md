# Content and Copy

The audience is CTOs and technical founders at funded startups. They can read code and they are allergic to hype. Every line either earns trust with a specific fact or costs trust with an adjective.

## The content layer

There is no CMS. Page content lives as **JSON** under `content/`, parsed through a zod schema at the module boundary and imported by server components — see [data-persistence](../data-persistence/SKILL.md). MongoDB exists, but it stores submitted data only and never serves page content.

```
content/
  work.json  team.json  testimonials.json  brands.json  roles.json
  stats.json  services.json  process.json  opensource.json
```

Rules:

- Every content file is parsed once in `lib/content/index.ts` through its zod schema in `lib/content/schemas.ts`, and the TypeScript type is `z.infer` of that schema — never a hand-written interface beside it. `types/index.ts` holds only the shapes that are **not** content (the GitHub `Commit`) and re-exports the content-derived ones it shares with the data layer (`Repo`).
- Slugs are the join key between content and dynamic routes. Slug is `kebab-case`, stable, and never changes after publish.
- Content files hold data and prose. **No JSX, no Tailwind classes, no components** in `content/`.
- Content is also the typed fallback when a live source fails — see [data-and-forms](../data-and-forms/SKILL.md).
- Adding a field means updating the interface first, then every entry. No optional field added just to avoid backfilling.

## Voice

- **Plain, specific, confident.** Numbers over adjectives.
- **Name what the client gets, not how we build it.** "A working release in six weeks," not "agile delivery methodology."
- **Sentence case everywhere**, except the mono utility face, which is uppercase.
- **Buttons say what happens.** "Book a call," not "Get started." The label keeps its name through the whole flow — the button, the page title, and the confirmation all say the same word.
- **Case study lines follow:** problem → what we built → measurable outcome. One sentence each.
- Prose max measure `65ch`. If a paragraph runs past four lines, it is two paragraphs or it is padding.

## Banned

Hype vocabulary: _cutting-edge, synergy, leverage (as a verb), seamless, robust, world-class, passionate, we're excited to, revolutionize, empower, best-in-class, game-changing, solutions provider, digital transformation._

Also banned: exclamation marks in body copy, em-dash-heavy breathless sentences, rhetorical questions as headlines ("Ready to scale?"), and any claim with no number behind it.

**The CTO test.** Read each line as the buyer. If a sentence makes a claim you cannot substantiate with a number, a name, or a repo, cut it or replace it with the fact underneath it.

## Copy that is easy to get wrong

**Empty states** — say what would appear here and offer an action. Never "No data." → _"No open roles right now. Tell us what you'd want to work on and we'll reach out when there is."_

**Error states** — what happened and what to do, in the interface's voice. No apology, no stack trace, no "Oops!" → _"That didn't send. Check the email field, or write to hello@… directly."_

**Loading** — a skeleton, not a sentence. If you must label it, name the thing being fetched.

**Alt text** — describes the image's information, not its existence. A project cover: _"Dashboard showing p95 latency dropping from 1.4s to 180ms after the migration."_ Decorative images get `alt=""`.

**Meta descriptions** — one specific sentence per page. Never repeat the site tagline across routes.

**Testimonials** — quote what someone actually said, attributed to a real name, role, and company. Never write a quote on a client's behalf and never paraphrase into our own voice. If the attribution can't be published, cut the quote.

**Job descriptions** — say what you'd own, what the first 90 days are, and the comp band. No "rockstar", "ninja", "wear many hats", or "fast-paced environment".

## Placeholders

Placeholder copy is a defect, not a TODO. A section is not done with lorem ipsum, `[Client name]`, invented metrics, or a `#` href in it. If the real fact does not exist yet, **cut the element** and note the gap in `MILESTONES.md` rather than filling it with fiction.
