/**
 * The marketing chrome.
 *
 * This used to live in `app/layout.tsx`, which meant every route in the app —
 * including the admin portal — inherited Header, Footer, Scene and Grain with
 * no way to opt out. A nested layout can add to its parent but can never
 * remove what the parent already rendered, so the chrome had to move DOWN a
 * level rather than be conditionally suppressed at the root.
 *
 * The root layout keeps `<html>`/`<body>`, the fonts and the theme script, so
 * there is still exactly one root layout and the portal is a plain nested
 * layout under it (`app/(admin)/layout.tsx`).
 *
 * Returns a fragment on purpose: `body` is the flex column, and a wrapper div
 * here would make Header/Footer grandchildren of it and break the sticky
 * footer.
 *
 * `modal` is the parallel slot that lets `/work/[slug]` open over the page a
 * visitor is on (§6.2). On a client-side navigation the slot renders the
 * intercepted route; on a direct load, a refresh, or a shared link it renders
 * `@modal/default.tsx` (nothing) and `children` is the full case-study page.
